This program plays local two player Slapjack using keyboard controls.
-->
<!-- Rules:
- Both players start with 26 cards
- Players keep placing cards using "Q" or "[" till they see Jack
- Slapjack using "W" or "]"
- Person who Slapjack's first gets all the cards 
    - use .length to keep track of the cards each player gets
    - keep track of which cards are in the middle/the cards each player has using array
- Repeat until one player gets all the cards
- Player with all the cards win
-->
<!-- Not Working:
- In a case where a player has no cards left and jack was NOT the last card played, player with most card does not show winning

            <h4>Game and Rules:</h4>
            <li>The goal of Tapjack is to have all the cards in your hand.</li>
            <li>Each player will place a card down (using "Q" or "[") until they see a "J - Jack" card.</li>
            <li>When a Jack is placed, both players will try to tap their "Jack!" key ("W" or "]") as fast as they can!</li>
            <li>Whoever taps their key the fastest wins all the cards that were placed (aka, the pile)!</li>
            <li>The process repeats until one player has all the cards.</li>
            <li>If a player taps their Jack! key before a Jack is on screen, that player will be penalized for 2 turns and cannot use their Jack! key.</li>
